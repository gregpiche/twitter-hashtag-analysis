# Twitter Hashtag Emotion Analysis
As the title suggests, this application allows a user to input a hashtag and the application will then retrieve the 100 most recent Tweets and determine the public emotion regarding the retrieved Tweets. The emotions are displayed in a bar chart with the percentages for the 5 emotions used by Watson NLU (Sadness, Joy, Fear, Disgust, Anger). A screenshot below shows the UI for the application after a user wanted to know the emotions regarding the new HBO show House Of The Dragon.

## Technology Used
* Python with flask as backend
* HTML/CSS/JS for frontend and to handle server requests
* Chart.js for visual representation of the emotions
* Twitter API with elevated access to retrieve Tweets
* IBM Watson NLU to determine emotions of keywords found in retrieved Tweets
